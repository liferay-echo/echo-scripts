NAME
     wh-labels.cgi -- Label pull requests.

SYNOPSIS
     wh-labels.cgi

DESCRIPTION
     This CGI script is a Github webhook that, when a pull_request.open event
     is received, will:

     o   Label the pull request depending on its contents.

     The commenting business should be pretty straightforward; the labeling
     criteria is the following:

     o   If the pull request contains any .java, .jsp, .jspf, or .xml file,
         then the label backend review needed will be assigned.

     o   If it contains .js, .css, or .html files, then the label
         frontend review needed will be assigned.

     o   If there are any files with the .macro, .path or .testcase then the qa
         review needed label will be used.

     Note that the label behavior will change depending on the contents of the
     .wh/labels/ directory and the ./wh/users file.

FILES
     wh-labels.cgi uses restricted services of the Github REST API. Access to
     these services require a user token, that must be saved in the .wh/whtoken
     file.  For example, if wh-labels.cgi will act in name of the user 'foo'
     with token 'abc', the contents of the file will be 'foo:abc' - user name
     and token separated by a colon. This token must be in its own line, with no
     blanks other than the final newline.  The file must not contain anything
     else.

     To assign the labels, wh-labels.cgi will examine the set of files stored in
     .wh/labels/.  Any file there will be taken as a label (i.e. the name of
     the file will be the name of the label).  Each of these label files must
     contain the set of extensions that will trigger that label assignment
     (this extension must not contain the dot).  Each extension must be in its
     own line.

     No label will be added if the user opening the pull request is found in
     the .wh/users file, where each user which should be skipped should be added
     in a separate line.
