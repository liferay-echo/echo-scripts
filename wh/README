wh.cgi(1)                 BSD General Commands Manual                wh.cgi(1)

NAME
     wh.cgi -- Add comment to pull requests.

SYNOPSIS
     wh.cgi

DESCRIPTION
     This CGI script is a Github webhook that, when a pull_request.open event
     is received, will:

     o   Add a comment, referencing the Pull Request Template of the repository.

FILES
     wh.cgi uses restricted services of the Github REST API.  Access to these
     services require a user token, that must be saved in the .wh/whtoken
     file.  For example, if wh.cgi will act in name of the user 'foo' with
     token 'abc', the contents of the file will be 'foo:abc' - user name and
     token separated by a colon. This token must be in its own line, with no
     blanks other than the final newline.  The file must not contain anything
     else.
